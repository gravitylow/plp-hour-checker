#PLP Volunteer Hour Checker

##Why?
It's pretty inconvenient to check your current hours in the program.
Currently you have to download an `html` document badly formatted, with an incorrect`xlsx` mimetype. It would take an inconvenient amount of time to check total hours this way.

PLP Volunteer hour checker automates this process and outputs:

- Total hours for the semester
- Total hours for the year
- Total hours for the entirety of the PLP program
